# üöÄ Update Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ **Changes Made**

1. **Fixed Workflow ID Mismatch**:
   - Changed workflow ID from `'web3-audit-workflow'` to `'web3AuditWorkflow'`
   - This matches what your client is expecting: `mastraClient.getWorkflow('web3AuditWorkflow')`

2. **Updated Workflow Definition**:
   - Added description field for better API documentation
   - Moved `.commit()` to the workflow chain (best practice)
   - Ensured compatibility with new Mastra workflow API

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Updated test scripts to show which workflow name is being used
   - Better diagnostic information for troubleshooting

## üîÑ **How to Apply Changes**

### Step 1: Rebuild Your Mastra Project

```bash
cd mastra_agents
npm run build
# or
mastra build
```

### Step 2: Redeploy to Mastra Cloud

If you're using Mastra Cloud, you have two options:

**Option A: Git Push (if connected to GitHub)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix workflow ID and API compatibility"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Upload**
- Upload your updated `mastra_agents` folder to Mastra Cloud
- Ensure the deployment uses the updated workflow files

### Step 3: Test the Updated Deployment

```bash
cd ../workflow-test
npm run test
```

## üîç **What Should Work Now**

1. **Workflow Discovery**: `getWorkflows()` should return your workflow
2. **Workflow Access**: `getWorkflow('web3AuditWorkflow')` should work
3. **Workflow Execution**: `createRunAsync()` and `start()` should execute successfully

## üêõ **If You Still Get Errors**

### Check Deployment Status
1. Verify your Mastra Cloud deployment completed successfully
2. Check deployment logs for any build errors
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

### Test with Diagnostic Tools
```bash
# Use the instant HTML tester
open workflow-test/instant-test.html

# Or run the enhanced command line test
cd workflow-test && npm run test
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `404 - Not found` | Workflow not deployed or wrong name | Check deployment status, verify workflow ID |
| `createRun() deprecated` | Using old API | Ensure you're using `createRunAsync()` |
| `Empty workflows object` | Server not exposing workflows | Check Mastra server configuration |
| `CORS errors` | Cross-origin request blocked | Configure CORS in Mastra server settings |

## üéØ **Expected Results**

After redeployment, your API tests should show:

```json
{
  "getWorkflows": {
    "web3AuditWorkflow": { 
      "id": "web3AuditWorkflow",
      "description": "Comprehensive Web3 smart contract security audit workflow"
    }
  }
}
```

And workflow execution should work with:
```typescript
const workflow = mastraClient.getWorkflow('web3AuditWorkflow');
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { ... } });
```

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the Mastra Cloud deployment logs
2. Verify the server URL is correct
3. Run the diagnostic HTML tool to see what's actually available
4. Ensure your GitHub repository (if using) has the latest changes
